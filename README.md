  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>

  <p>
    Hi, I’m <strong>Olalekan</strong> — a <strong>Power BI Specialist / Business Intelligence Developer</strong>
    with <strong>5+ years of experience</strong> building reliable, high-impact analytics solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    I specialise in <strong>Power BI (DAX, Power Query, data modelling)</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>,
    with a strong focus on creating dashboards that are visually clear, performant, and genuinely useful
    for decision-making. I’ve worked closely with finance, operations, product, and commercial teams to
    translate business questions into scalable BI solutions.
  </p>

  <p>
    In my day-to-day work, I own the full lifecycle of Power BI reporting — from requirements gathering and
    data modelling to optimisation, governance, and documentation. I enjoy improving inefficient reporting
    processes, resolving data quality issues, and making complex data accessible to non-technical users.
  </p>

  <p>
    Alongside Power BI, I use <strong>SQL</strong> for data validation and transformation,
    <strong>Excel</strong> for deep analysis, and <strong>Python (Pandas, NumPy)</strong> for ad-hoc analytics.
    I also have exposure to <strong>Azure-based data platforms</strong> and cloud data concepts, and I’m
    actively developing my skills around <strong>embedded analytics and product-led BI</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    I’m passionate about using data to drive better outcomes, particularly in
    <strong>product, financial services, and health/care-focused environments</strong>,
    where accuracy, trust, and usability really matter.
  </p>
